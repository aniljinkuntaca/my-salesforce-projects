Hey there 👋  
This repo is my personal collection of Salesforce projects — dashboards, utilities, and apps I built while exploring and preparing for interviews.  

Instead of keeping them scattered, I wanted one place where I can showcase them all.  

---

## 📂 Projects

### 1. AI Case Dashboard
A Lightning Web Component + Apex powered dashboard that:  
- Classifies cases into categories (Billing, Technical, General) using a simple AI-like Apex service  
- Shows confidence scores  
- Lets you filter, sort, and paginate cases  
- Supports inline edits and exporting data  

👉 [Check the code here](https://github.com/aniljinkuntaca/my-salesforce-projects/tree/ai-case-dashboard)

### 2. *(coming soon 🚧)* 

---

## 🛠️ Tech I Play With
- Salesforce Apex & Triggers  
- Lightning Web Components (LWC)  
- OmniStudio (OmniScripts, FlexCards, Integration Procedures)  
- SOQL/SOSL & REST/SOAP Integrations  
- Salesforce DX for source-driven dev  

---

## ⚡ How to Try It Out
1. Clone this repo  
2. Jump into a project folder (example: `cd ai-case-dashboard`)  
3. Authorize your Salesforce org:  
   ```sh
   sfdx auth:web:login -a myOrg
Push the code:

sh
Copy
Edit
sfdx force:source:push -u myOrg
Assign any needed permission sets and you’re good to go 🚀

✨ Why This Repo?
I wanted to keep my hands dirty with Salesforce and also have a neat portfolio of projects that show what I can build — from Apex utilities to full dashboards.

💡 If you’re a fellow dev or recruiter checking this out — welcome! Feedback and ideas are always appreciated 😄
